# SWAT+ NetCDF Converter

This repository contains tools for converting SWAT+ model weather input data to NetCDF format. These tools are designed to work with the NetCDF-supported version of SWAT+.

## Implementations

This project provides two implementations of the converter:

- **[C++ Implementation](c++/README.md)**: A high-performance, compiled version of the converter.
- **[Python Implementation](python/README.md)**: A Python-based version of the converter tools.

## SWAT+ NetCDF Support

These tools are intended to be used with the SWAT+ version that supports NetCDF. The source code for SWAT+ with NetCDF support can be found in the `netCDF-Support` branch of the official SWAT+ repository:
